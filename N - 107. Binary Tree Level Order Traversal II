/*
Given a binary tree, 
return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. 
(ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
*/
/*
1. Post order traversal:
Use potorder traversal to get all nodes
Create a function that extracts every [1st, 2nd] value pairs, then store the 3rd in an array
Call this function until only 1 node is left, return that node

2. Post order traversal with callback 
Use potorder traversal to get all nodes
Store the depth of each recursion, and the resulting nodes
Return the node pairs from highest depth to lowest depth
