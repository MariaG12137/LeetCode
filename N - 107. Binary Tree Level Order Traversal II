/*
Given a binary tree, 
return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. 
(ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
*/
/*
1. Post order traversal:
Use potorder traversal to get all nodes
Create a function that extracts every [1st, 2nd] value pairs, then store the 3rd in an array
Call this function until only 1 node is left, return that node
